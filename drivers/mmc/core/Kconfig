config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Allow unsafe resume (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.

config MMC_DETECT_SYNC
	bool "Synchronous MMC detection processing"
	depends on MACH_LAB126
	default y
	help
	  This selects whether or not to have MMC card detection processing
	  operate in a synchronous fashion for non-IRQ-based card insertion
	  events.  This must be enabled for Mario MoviNAND-based platforms.
